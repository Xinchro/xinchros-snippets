# xinchros-snippets
A collection of personal Sublime Text(3) snippets.

## Installation
To "install" these snippets, simply navigate to whichever directory is appropriate for your system (listed below) and clone this repo. Sadly, the `readme.md` and `.gitignore` will be included(no harm, annoying), but I don't know how to prevent that, so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

`git clone git@github.com:Xinchro/xinchros-snippets.git`

- Windows:
    - `%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3`
- OS X:
    - `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3`
- Linux:
    - `~/.config/sublime-text-3`
